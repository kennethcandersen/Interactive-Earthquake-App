**REPOSITORY NAVIGATION**

* [*Index file with HTML code*](https://github.com/kennethcandersen/D3-Challenge/blob/main/D3_data_journalism/index.html) sets up the graphic's structure online. 
* [*JS file with Javascript code*](https://github.com/kennethcandersen/D3-Challenge/blob/main/D3_data_journalism/assets/js/appv2.js) retrieves CSV data, processes it, creates data visualization plot with multiple axes using D3, and inserts the plots into the HTML code (see Steps section below for more detail). 

**OBJECTIVE**

Create an interactive graphic that users to dynamically explore the correlation between demographic data and health risks by state in the United States.


**STEPS, TOOLS & LANGUAGES USED**

1. Create the structure in HTML.
2. Create and test the JS file that does the following:
  - Accesses data from a CSV file. 
  - Uses D3 to set up an SVG graphic. 
  - Builds the SVG graphic with multiple axes.
  - Plots data with labels and toot tips.  
  - Creates event listener functions to display data when the mouse hovers over a data label. 
  - Execututes an animated transition when a different axis is selected and new data is plotted.
